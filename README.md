# A/B Testing for GloBox Main Webpage

**Introduction:** GloBox, an online marketplace, aimed to boost awareness of its "Food and Drinks" category by adding a special banner to its mobile webpage. This report presents the findings of an A/B test conducted to assess the impact on sales revenue. The test compared the Control group (Group A) with the Treatment group (Group B) to measure differences in the conversion rate and average amount spent per user.

**Methodology:** The experiment involved random assignment of mobile website visitors to either the Control or Treatment group. A total of 48,943 participants (24,343 Control, 24,600 Treatment) took part in the 13-day experiment (January 25, 2023, to February 6, 2023).

**Results:**

1.  **Conversion Rate:** The Control group had a conversion rate of 3.92%, while the Treatment group had a rate of 4.63%, indicating a statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.0001).
    
2.  **Average Amount Spent:** The Control group's average amount spent per user was $3.37, and the Treatment group's was $3.39, with no statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.944).
    
3.  **Sample Size Analysis:** The sample size was sufficient for conversion rate analysis but impractical for the average amount spent by user.
    

**Additional Analyses:**

-   A histogram illustrated the distribution of average amount spent per user for each group, highlighting key spending ranges.
-   Relationship analyses showed varying impacts on metrics based on user's device, gender, and country.

**Recommendations:** Based on the findings, it is not recommended to launch the experiment. While there is a statistically significant difference in conversion rate, the lack of an increase in average amount spent suggests that the banner may not significantly boost revenue. Additionally, the relationship analyses raise concerns about the stability of revenue changes based on user characteristics.
